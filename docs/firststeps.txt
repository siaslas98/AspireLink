Great first step: **Define and implement your MVP backend structure.**

Here's a clear sequence:

1. **Define Core Features for MVP**
   Focus on essential functionality:

   * User accounts (auth, sessions)
   * Internship entries (company, role, status)
   * Watchlist system
   * Notification stubs (can be mocked initially)
   * Points/streak tracking (basic version)

2. **Set Up Project Repo**

   * Use FastAPI project layout (routers, services, models, etc.)
   * Set up Docker, PostgreSQL, and GitHub Actions early
   * Create README with setup instructions for team

3. **Design DB Schema**

   * Tables: `users`, `internships`, `watchlist`, `applications`, `motivations`
   * Use SQLAlchemy ORM

4. **Build Initial API Endpoints**

   * `/register`, `/login`, `/logout`
   * `/internships` (CRUD)
   * `/watchlist` (add/remove)
   * `/motivation/status`

5. **Test Locally & Push Baseline Code**

   * Confirm local dev environment works for everyone

Start small, get it working, then iterate. Want a scaffolded FastAPI template to start from?
