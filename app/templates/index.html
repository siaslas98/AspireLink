<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<div class="poem">
  <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</p>
  <p>And sorry I could not travel both</p>
  <p>And be one traveler, long I stood</p>
  <p>And looked down one as far as I could</p>
  <p>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

  <br />

  <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,</p>
  <p>And having perhaps the better claim,</p>
  <p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</p>
  <p>Though as for that the passing there</p>
  <p>Had worn them really about the same,</p>

  <br />

  <p>And both that morning equally lay</p>
  <p>In leaves no step had trodden black.</p>
  <p>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</p>
  <p>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</p>
  <p>I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

  <br />

  <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh</p>
  <p>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</p>
  <p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”</p>
  <p>I took the one less traveled by,</p>
  <p>And that has made all the difference.</p>
