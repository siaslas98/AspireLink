## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

**Internship Support Tool** is a web-based platform designed to help university studentsâ€”especially those in technical fieldsâ€”stay organized and motivated during the internship application process. The platform combines two key features:

- ðŸ”” **Watchlist Notifications** â€“ Students can track specific companies and receive alerts when new internship opportunities are posted.
- ðŸ’¡ **Motivational Tools** â€“ Check-ins, reminders, and gamified elements like streaks and badges encourage consistent progress.

This tool aims to reduce the stress of internship hunting by centralizing opportunity tracking, boosting accountability, and supporting students' long-term career growth.
